# Fraud Detection System

## Overview
This project is a Fraud Detection System built using machine learning algorithms. It aims to predict fraudulent transactions using data from credit card transactions. The system uses a dataset of credit card transactions to train a machine learning model and detect potential fraud.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning and transforming the dataset for model training.
- **Model Training:** Using algorithms like Random Forest or Gradient Boosting to train the model.
- **Fraud Detection:** Predicting fraudulent transactions based on trained models.
- **Evaluation:** Performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: The main programming language for implementing the system.
- **Scikit-learn**: Used for machine learning algorithms.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations and array handling.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **Jupyter Notebook/VS Code**: For writing and testing the code.
